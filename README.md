## About me

My career started as an electronic engineer, understanding how technology works from the transistor level. With a strong base of structured programming languages applied directly to microprocessors firmware, I have been able to continue learning higher level programming languages consciously, always trying to find the equilibrium between ease of implementation and performance needed for each use case. 

Now I am focused on how the infrastructure is designed to run highly scalable and reliable applications in conjunction with the cloud, but I also really enjoy the design and development process of the application itself, which allows me to connect the challenges between the two worlds and successfully deliver a great end-to-end solution. 

Above all am a technologist. I know and accept that in the IT industry things move faster than a single developer can learn, but I do my best at staying up to date in the topics I am interested in and are useful for my current position, always reading and implementing new things in personal projects I use to finish understanding new concepts. What makes me a good technologist is my enthusiasm for learning new, alternative, or more efficient ways of solving problems we might already have an answer for.
